        why do we use object oriented,are there any limitations here in javascript?
        => we use OOPs to write Business Application,
        => Being as a software developer we design two types of applications: System s/w and Application s/w
        => (1) Systm s/w: OS, device Drivers, Machine Level Interfacing (C-language,Embedded c,Machine level programming) 
        => it needs code should be compiled with less CPU and less Memory(Procedural Programming)
        
        
        => (2) Application s/w: Business Application (OOPs is used here) bcaz B`App are complex and vast.
        => this programming requires more CPU Cycles and more space for exection smoothely
